Preliminary testing shows this library to be up to 40X faster than the 
built-in Julia arrays when evaluating matrix expressions involving "small"
matricies (i.e. 3X1 and 3X3 matricies).

The expectation is that this library may be useful for multi-body dynamics
simulations, and perhaps other computational mechanics applications that require
repeated evaluation of expressions involving "small" matricies.

NOTES: 
1. This is a developer prevew version.
2. The 1x3 matrix is not yet supported.
